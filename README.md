## Dating

Judging from the name of the directory at

    http://cdna.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/Vindija/VCF/Vindija33.19

this is specimen Vi-33.19.

Redating is discussed in \citet{Deviese:PNA-10.1073-pnas.1709235114}.

"Vi-33.19 (level G3) was also dated using the hydroxyproline method
and produced a date of 44,300 $\pm$ 1,200 B.P., which is a more precise
date than the one obtained using the AF procedure (45,300 $\pm$ 2,300
B.P.)."

From Kay Prufer:

Dear Alan,

the sequences are aligned against hg19/GRCh37. The detailed information is
hidden in the bam/ directory README. I'll add this information to the
VCF README so that it is easier to find. Sorry!

Cheers,
Kay.
